                The lab language is English. Any professional conversation, oral and written, during
                work activities must be in English: these include presentations and discussion at
                lab meetings, scientific output, and email exchanges. Feel free to use LLMs to
                proofread and refine written text. However, fully AI generated text is not acceptable.
                Outside of professional meetings, the lab strives for inclusive communication: verbal
                exchanges should adopt the common language that allow everyone present to participate.

            <p class="p_text">
                Discussing scientific progress is essential for the success of our projects. I expect
                all lab members to actively participate in our scheduled meetings:<br><br>

                Lab Meetings: Each lab member will host our weekly lab meeting on a rotating schedule,
                presenting an informal progress report. These reports, lasting 20-30 minutes, should
                succinctly introduce your project, highlight the main research questions, and focus on
                recent achievements and challenges. This allows for productive group discussions to
                advance your project. Lab meetings are typically held once per week within core working
                hours, lasting 60 to 90 minutes. Progress report presentations are accessible via our
                lab’s shared resources.<br><br>

                Journal Club: On a rotating schedule, each lab member will present the core hypotheses,
                methods, results, and conclusions of a recent original research paper relevant to our
                lab’s research in our monthly journal club. All members are expected to read the paper
                and actively participate in discussing its strengths, weaknesses, and key takeaways.
                The journal club is typically held once per week within core working hours and lasts
                about 60 minutes.<br><br>

                1-on-1 Meetings: I schedule bi-weekly 1-on-1 in-person meetings which each lab member,
                typically lasting around 1 hour, during core work hours [details below]. These meetings
                are designed to support you in successfully implementing your research project. I am
                also available for additional meetings upon request.<br><br>

                Yearly Appraisals: I will review your project's long-term progress and provide tailored
                feedback on your work performance during yearly appraisals. This is also an opportunity
                for you to give me feedback on your experience working in the lab, and under my
                supervision.
            </p>

                -In the leadup to the meeting, draw attention to the resources available.<br>
                -Books and resources for self-education.<br>
                -Group leader should discuss spending, grants and outlook for the future.

                -New group leaders could combine lab retreats/lab meetings to improve feedback.<br>
                -Communicate feedback decisions and if suggestions are not implemented, explain why.<br>
                -Follow up on feedback implementation.

                Students and trainees who feel they have experienced or witnessed bullying harassment
                or sexual misconduct by another student may make a formal report to XXXX by email.
                This process may also be initiated through Human resources, the lab manager, or group
                leader.<br><br>

                Members of staff who feel they have experienced or witnessed bullying, harassment or
                sexual misconduct may make a formal complaint against a staff member by using the
                Staff Grievance Policy or they may make a formal complaint against a student by
                contacting XXXX by email.<br><br>

                Students or members of staff who feel they have experienced or witnessed bullying,
                harassment or sexual misconduct by a third party, or a member of the public, should
                discuss this with their line manager, supervisor or personal tutor in the first
                instance. This may involve notifying third parties and using their complaints
                procedure or notifying Security and/or the police when involving members of the
                public.<br><br>

                <i>Outcome of a complaint/ disciplinary case</i><br>
                The Reporting Party will be told whether their complaint has been upheld or not;
                and whether the Reported Party has been dismissed or expelled. If the complaint
                is not upheld or the Reported Party is not dismissed or expelled, information
                will be shared with the Reporting Party to minimise any adverse effects in
                accessing their work or study environment, where possible, but there may be
                limits to the information about the consequences to the Reported Party that
                can be shared with the Reporting Party.<br><br>

                Where the Reporting Party is told the outcome they will be asked to respect
                confidentiality with regards to the outcome. Links to institute guidelines

            <p class="p_text">
                Mental well-being is crucial for personal and professional success, especially
                given the prevalence of mental health challenges in academia
                (https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.4089). High productivity doesn’t equate to overwork.
                Lab members are encouraged to manage their productivity responsibly and are not
                expected to exceed working regular work hours. If you feel comfortable, I
                encourage you to discuss any personal challenges that may affect your work
                during our 1-on-1 meetings. If you need additional support, I encourage you to
                consider the following resources:<br><br>

                Counseling Services: Our institution offers free counseling services
                [Insert Link]
                and free 1-on-1 coaching [Insert Link] for all students and employees. Please
                also consult the institute’s resources on a healthy work-life balance [Insert
                Link].<br><br>

                All lab members are expected to maintain a professional attitude of integrity,
                accountability, and mutual respect in all interactions and endeavours while
                upholding high standards of scientific rigor and collaboration. Examples
                include respecting each other’s points of views and contributions to discussions,
                being timely for meetings, and actively engaging in each other’s presentations.
                Everyone commits to maintaining an inclusive environment marked by compassionate
                behaviour and free from offensive conduct, particularly regarding gender, race,
                sexuality, or disability. Lab members are free to voice their ideas, wishes, or
                concerns without risking negative consequences ensuring a psychologically safe
                environment.

                AI language models may be used for grammar, spelling, and style checks; for
                writing and debugging code; and for literature searches. Copy‑pasting complete
                AI‑generated paragraphs is not allowed—AI output should be treated as a draft
                and edited for accuracy and voice. AI‑generated code can be used to analyse or
                plot data provided it is thoroughly reviewed and tested. All literature
                information retrieved via AI must be fact‑checked against primary sources, as AI
                tools can hallucinate or be biased. Before using any AI tools, ensure compliance
                with our institute’s data privacy and confidentiality policies. We will revisit
                and refine these guidelines during yearly research‑integrity meetings.

            <p class="p_text">
                The lab strives to minimise energy consumption and waste production. We identified
                three main areas of impact: travel, recycling and economical use of equipment.
                <br><br>
                Travel: I encourage sustainable transport options both for long-haul travel and
                for daily commute. For long-hauls trips, when funding allows, I will cover the most
                sustainable travel option (up to double the price of the cheapest alternative). I
                also recognise remote-working hours spent productively on sustainable means of
                transport during private (non-work related) trips. I incentivize sustainable
                options for daily commute: PhD students enrolled at University of Trento benefit
                from free public transportation across the Trentino region; all the lab members
                can participate in an annual contest where commuting milage is logged and scored
                according to sustainability of the means of transport, the person who accrues the

                Recycling: To minimize the environmental impact of lab waste, we avoid mixing
                truly contaminated materials (which is expensive and environmentally harmful to
                safely dispose of) with clean recyclable waste. We equip our lab with additional
                recycling bins and take responsibility for disposing of the recovered recyclables
                according to local
                regulations.

            <p class="p_text">
                I am committed to creating a healthy work environment for all lab members.
                I anticipate all lab members taking a minimum of [institution’s] prescribed
                days of annual leave. "Minimum" because if experiments/conferences necessitate
                working on a weekend, I support lab members taking time off to compensate. I hope
                to schedule all meetings within [institution’s] “core” work hours, and will refrain
                from sending, or answering, non-urgent emails/messages outside of work hours.<br><br>

                All full-time lab members should aim to work onsite at least four days a week.
                I expect this number to reduce (probably to "three") once the lab is operational
                and more time is being spent analysing data rather than building rigs/training mice.
                In general, I believe that some regular onsite presence is important to maintain the
                lab community. However, I am happy to support intermittent periods of fully-remote
                working when, for example, traveling/visiting family abroad or writing up a thesis/grant.

                is findable and transparent. Everyone can see each other’s entries; the PI is the only person
                who adds or removes access. Before you leave, export a PDF of your notebook—access to the
                shared account ends unless you stay involved on that project. We review notebooks once a year,
                usually ahead of appraisals.<br><br>

                To prevent data loss, back up all data monthly to the designated server; parking a lone
                copy on an external drive is not acceptable. All data should be retained until the person’s
                employment concludes, after which a review will be held with the group leader to determine
                what should be archived and what should be deleted.<br><br>

                Shared resources—presentations, protocols, plasmid DB, reagents, freezers/LN2, ordering

                not last longer than 1 year. If finishing previous work is expected to last longer than 1 year,
                postdoctoral researchers should delay the start of their position in the lab whenever possible.

            <p class="p_text">
                Our team is composed by researchers with different roles: post-doctoral researchers,
                PhD students, undergraduate (Master or Bachelor) students and research assistants/engineers.
                These roles, which may correspond to different career stages and seniority, typically come
                with different duties and responsibilities. Typical responsibilities are summarised by the
                table below. Exceptions may be made in discussion with me—typically during onboarding.

            <p class="p_text">
                Every PhD and postdoctoral researcher position in the lab inevitably has its own set of
                experimental challenges and funding complications. Therefore, it is impossible to predict
                the outcome of any project, and I cannot make guarantees with respect to timelines or
                publications. However, my ambition for each role is as follows:<br><br>

                PhD students in the UK typically graduate ~4 years after joining the lab, and it is my aim that
                each student has at least one first (or co-first) authored publication on bioRxiv at that time.
                I select PhD projects (in discussion with the student) with this aim in mind. Depending on the
                current funding status of the lab, it is often possible for students to remain in the lab for a
                period after their PhD, and this will be discussed at least one year in advance of graduation.<br><br>

                Postdoctoral researchers typically join the lab with an initial contract, and the length of that
                contract depends on both the source of funding and their proposed project. All positions in the
                university are also subject a 12-month probationary period. I will be transparent about these
                restrictions in the initial job advertisement, and in discussions with any applicant. I aim to
                propose projects (in discussion with the researcher) to maximise the chance of a publication
                within the initial contract's timeframe. At least one year before the end of the contract period,
                I will discuss the next steps with the researcher, which may include the option to stay longer
                in the lab (with or without applying for their own funding).

            <p class="p_text"><span class="smallerLargerTxt">Onboarding</span></p>
            <p class="p_text">
                Arriving in a new lab, town, and often country can be a challenging process. The lab has developed
                an onboarding procedure to help make this process go as smoothly as possible. There are institutional
                administrative activities that must be performed, and these are listed on the Wiki, along with details
                about how to complete them [Insert Link]. In addition, every new lab member is paired with a “lab buddy”
                (an existing member of the lab) who will arrange for you to meet each lab member individually and hear
                about the work they are doing. Unless I am traveling, we will have our first 1-on-1 meeting during your
                first day in the lab. This will include a discussion of your project in the lab, but also guidance on
                how you can access all the information and lab policies specified in the SAFE Labs Lab Culture Handbook.

            <p class="p_text"><span class="smallerLargerTxt">Leaving the lab</span></p>
            <p class="p_text">
                I aim to provide lab members with mentorship and support to secure the next career
                step in their career. Job and/or grant applications, and preparing for subsequent
                interviews, takes time. Typically, after discussions during 1-on-1 meetings, I
                support dedicating up to 25% of research time to this endeavour.<br><br>

                I am best equipped to help with academic career trajectories: I offer mentorship
                at 1-on-1 meetings and will devote time to rehearse interview talks. However,
                academia is one of many available career paths. For career paths outside academia,
                the institute, and external organisations (e.g. Nature Jobs fair), offer events
                and workshops. I support lab members making use of these resources.<br><br>

                I understand that people decide to leave the lab for different reasons, and may
                need to do so before their projects are complete. I ask that lab members discuss
                their plans with me as early as possible—preferably at least 6 months before
                their intended departure. This helps to ensure a smooth leaving process: the
                final months will include the hand-over of any knowledge and data needed to
                ensure documentation, continuity and completion of ongoing projects. As the
                final step prior to departure, I will organise an exit interview, carried out
                in private with a colleague (e.g. a SAFE lab network associate). During the
                interview, departing lab members will be able to discuss the reasons for leaving
                and provide constructive feedback based on their experience.

            <p class="p_text">
                Authorship vs acknowledgement is not always clear for a publication, but typically all
                contributors to a paper are included as authors, where contribution is broadly defined by
                CRediT Taxonomy. For example, developing a new technique for a project, or contributing
                previously unpublished data/figures would constitute authorship. Conversely, routine
                experimental work, sharing basic analysis code, or proof-reading a paper would not constitute
                authorship. Authorship is ultimately decided in discussions between the group leader,
                project lead(s), and any other potential authors. Although the scientific process is
                unpredictable, authorship will be discussed when a lab member begins, or becomes involved
                with, a project. Whenever possible, we publish a matrix of contributions at the end of each
                paper.

                Reference letters will be provided to lab members at request, but these requests should
                be made at least 2 weeks in advance of the deadline for the first reference letter, and
                at least 1 week in advance for subsequent letters. Lab members should expect fair but
                honest evaluation of their performance and skills in the reference letters provided. As
                a rule, any additional supervisors (for example, a postdoctoral researcher who has
                supervised a student) of the lab member will be invited to contribute and sign the
                requested reference letter.

            <p class="p_text"><span class="smallerLargerTxt">Funding lab members</span></p>
            <p class="p_text">
                At XXX, salaries for postdoctoral researchers are determined by a national grading system
                [Insert Link]. All postdoctoral researchers in the lab start on grade XXXX, unless they
                have significant prior postdoctoral experience (e.g. have already completed a post doc
                in a lab other than their PhD lab). At the end of each year, salaries increase by one
                point on this grading system.<br><br>

                All postdoctoral researchers are required to apply for followships, both to benefit their
                own career and to improve lab finances. However, being awarded a fellowship is not a
                requirement. In cases when a researcher acquires their own funding through a competitive
                fellowship [Insert Link], this often comes with an increased salary. It may also come with
                dedicated funding for a lab technician to be managed by the researcher.<br><br>

                It is possible for postdoctoral fellows to be promoted to a senior-researcher level through
                an established institutional process. This is often most successful after acquiring their
                own grant or publishing a paper. I encourage all researchers to apply for promotion and
                will review the possibility during annual appraisals.<br><br>

                I will be transparent with postdoctoral researchers about the available funding for their
                position when they join the lab, and will discuss any.

                but are typically £5,000, comprising application costs, required language tests, and
                annual NHS contributions. The process typically takes 3-6 months, although this can vary
                significantly. At the time of writing, we typically cover all costs related to the visa

                I strive to ensure that all lab members in the same role have access to the resources they need to
                complete their project and advance their career. These include the financial resources to purchase
                equipment and attend conferences, sufficient access to shared resources (e.g. microscopes and behavioural
                rigs), and time/help from lab technicians and engineers. Anticipated resource requirements will be
                discussed at onboarding, and I keep a record of expenditure on different projects to ensure there are
                no major discrepancies. We have established systems for booking shared equipment and technician hours
                [Insert Link] which act as a historical record to ensure that these resources are not unfairly
                distributed. If you perceive any inequalities in the distribution of lab resources, please raise your
                concerns with me according to the procedure for raising lab or inter-personal issues [Insert Link].

                The above policies pertain to communal lab resources. Individuals with their own grants which, for
                example, allow them to hire a technician or travel to conferences will have exclusive (in the case
                of travel funding) or priority (in the case of staff or shared equipment) access to these resources.

                I encourage all lab members to seek and apply for training opportunities to develop new expertise,
                and the lab values initiative to disseminate the lab research at conferences.<br><br>

                Each postdoctoral researcher and PhD student has a budget of £1000 per year to attend conferences.
                This can be accumulated across years if that is the preference, and can be used for one expensive
                conference or multiple inexpensive conferences. Lab members do not need to present anything when
                attending their first conference after joining the lab, but should present at any future conferences,
                or organize a workshop/symposium, if they are planning to attend. If lab members have additional
                funds through grants or their PhD programme, these can be used in addition to the £1000 annual
                budget. I am happy to make an exception to this rule and provide extra funds if allowed by current
                grants, and an excellent opportunity arises (e.g. a unique conference, an invitation to give a
                prestigious talk) that would exceed this budget, but lab members should discuss with me before
                making any commitments.<br><br>

                Typically, I expect both PhD students and postdoctoral researchers to attend a competitive training
                school and/or a conference by the end of their second year in the lab. The lab will support
                applications (e.g. with recommendation letters) to these initiatives when they align with a
                project interest or planned career development. When funds are available, and application to fees
                waivers are not successful, the lab will cover the costs.<br><br>

                Master's students, undergraduates, and lab technicians are also encouraged to attend conferences
                if they have work to present. They should discuss these opportunities in advance with me. Often,
                there are grants available from conference organisers to support attendance, and if this is not
                the case, or the application for funds is unsuccessful, I will consider funding attendance on a
                case-by-case basis.
