                MsEE Lab considers its greatest impact to lie in helping shape the future of science.
                To do this effectively, a careful, deliberate, and reflexive approach to mentorship
                is key.

            <p class="p_text">
                Pablo views mentorship as his favorite part of the job and empowering others to bring about the
                science they see missing in the world is his main source of motivation for doing what he does.
                He puts a lot of effort and reflection into the best way of doing this (as shown by the fact
                that you're reading this). He aims to meet with lab members for 1 h every week to discuss
                research and career progress, both because he enjoys it and because
                <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.30084739it">
                    it is closely linked with PhD student satisfaction</a>. Frequent meetings and structured
                goals do not mean Pablo holds tight control over a project: lab members (particularly
                graduate students and postdoctoral researchers) are expected to
                set goals for themselves with the knowledge that adjustments are a normal part of the
                process. Pablo is here to help you achieve them while preserving your autonomy and
                flexibility.

            <div class="largerTxt" id="Projects">How are projects structured <br>at MsEE Lab?</div>

            <p class="p_text">
                One key strategy for a fulfilling research experience is to structure research projects according to their
                purpose. At MsEE Lab, we aim to structure PhD research according to three project archetypes. These include:
            </p>
            <ol class="p_text">
                <li><b>A Starter Project</b>: close mentorship and short-term results build the lab member's skills and confidence early on</li>
                <li><b>A Straightforward Project</b>: well-defined, long term goals within the capabilities available to the lab
                    provide a reliable way to advance the field and a roadmap to the lab member's next career steps (if applicable)</li>
                <li><b>An Exploratory Project</b>: risky, open-ended questions offer an exciting playground to
                    kindle engagement and open new research directions that may or may not be completed during the lab member's
                    time in the lab</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="p_text">
                Lab members in different career stages (or stages of their degree program) focus on each of these three project types
                in different ways, according to their goals and circumstances.
                It’s worth noting that the same project can (and often should) be worked on by multiple lab members,
                both in different moments and concurrently. Mentoring younger lab members on some of these projects
                is a source of growth and can provide purpose and engagement for everyone involved.
                Projects that don't fulfill their intended purpose (training, reliability, or engagement, respectively)
                should be adjusted or replaced—don't shy away from failing fast. We use
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_design">backwards design</a>
                and frequent, structured feedback to
                ensure a project's milestones and progress align with its overall goals.

                    A PhD stands for "philosophiae doctor", literally "teacher".</a>
                It signals that its bearer knows
                a field well enough to be able to teach about it. Teaching is a ubiquitous skill: every type
                of job involves training others in the skills required and/or explaining the job's importance
                to others. Because of this, a PhD is valuable across any number of jobs beyond "just"
                teaching positions (though perhaps not necessary for most of them).
            </p>
            <p class="p_text">
                The way that a PhD guarantees someone is able to teach is by expecting PhDs to make a new
                contribution to a field of knowledge. Since you must be sure that the new knowledge is
                actually new, you must know the field of knowledge in depth. Since nobody can teach you
                knowledge that doesn't yet exist, it means you taught it to yourself, so you must be able
                to teach (at least to yourself—most PhD programs can do a better job of teaching how to
                teach, though).
            </p>
            <p class="p_text">
                If you've decided you want to know a field of knowledge well enough to teach it and help
                expand it, then a PhD can be for you! A PhD is not the only way of achieving this, but it
                does offer a reliable opportunity to be able to do this with stability for a number of
                years.

            <p class="p_text">
                Masters degrees are intended to provide students with mastery over knowledge and
                techniques in a field without the expectation of learning how to contribute knowledge to it.
                To this end, masters students at MsEE Lab carry out a Starter Project and contribute to a
                Straightforward or Exploratory Project, <a onclick="goTo('Projects')">as described above</a>. The intended outcome is to
                acquire technical skills, rather than the understanding of how to build new knowledge.
                The same principles of backwards design mentioned above still apply. <a onclick="goTo('Pablo')">

            <p class="p_text">
                Undergraduate research experiences are intended to provide students with an introductory
                understanding of what it's like to do research in general and within the field in question
                in particular. To achieve this, you will have an assigned research mentor in the lab who
                can bring you onto an existing project as a Starter Project,

                If this is the case, then a key part of your job will be obtaining the firsthand
                experience of what research is like. This means that as much as possible,

                the choice of projects you work on should prioritize opportunities for you to fulfill your
